# RedParser

## Tests

However mocha-phantomjs dependencies are mapped to the version 1.9.*
It's required to have installed version [PhantomJS 2.0](https://github.com/eugene1g/phantomjs/releases) and use it for test running

Run tests with command:

```
./node_modules/.bin/mocha-phantomjs -p /usr/local/bin/phantomjs tests/redparser.html
```
